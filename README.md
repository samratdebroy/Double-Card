Need to install numpy before being able to run

## How to run
download or git clone the repo and remember the <PATH-TO-REPO> where you store the folder

using anaconda (open the Anaconda Prompt):
```
conda create --name DoubleCard python=3.7
conda activate DoubleCard
conda install numpy
cd <PATH-TO-REPO>

```

### For manual play
After running ''' python DoubleCard.py ''' in the Anaconda Prompt
Choose whether the first player plays as colors or dots

```
### Running test cases

##### Batch Input
to test multiple moves in one input run ''' python DoubleCard.py '''
then copy and paste the moves into the command prompt.
Note each move should be separated by a new line
Ex:
```
0 3 A 1
0 7 C 1
0 4 E 1
```

##### Recycling Mode
You can use: ``` python TestDoubleCard.py``` instead if you want to start with a board ready for recycling.
Then continue playing the game as usual using recycling moves.
